title: What is the conception of the devotees?

description: "Devotees consider all objects to be ingredients of the Lord's service. If we see things with a service attitude rather than a spirit of enjoyment, then everything is worshipable. If there is a gap in our hearing, chanting or remembering the Lord, then we will be swallowed by the idea that we are the enjoyer. If we become absorbed in gossip, we will lose the opportunity to associate with *sadhus* and therefore lose the serving mentality."
