title: What is the mentality of a surrendered soul?

description: "Unalloyed devotees of the Lord accept all the Lord's arrangements without argument. Displaying impatience about the Lord's arrangements proves that one lacks faith and desires material enjoyment. Devotees are not concerned whether the Lord's mercy seems like punishment, cruelty, or wealth because they are fully surrendered to the Lord. No amount of material inconvenience can distract them from their surrender or from accepting the Lord as their maintainer."

Unalloyed devotees of the Lord accept all the Lord's arrangements without argument. Displaying impatience about the Lord's arrangements proves that one lacks faith and desires material enjoyment. Devotees are not concerned whether the Lord's mercy seems like punishment, cruelty, or wealth because they are fully surrendered to the Lord. No amount of material inconvenience can distract them from their surrender or from accepting the Lord as their maintainer.

â€‹	The Lord is the ultimate seer of everything; but various obstacles impede the vision of the conditioned souls. By expressing displeasure at or restlessness with the Lord's arrnagements, one certainly invites inauspiciousness. The surrendered devotees have no concept other than to engage constantly in Lord Hari's service by being pleased to accept the Lord's arrangements.
