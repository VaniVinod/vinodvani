description: "Devotees consider all objects to be ingredients of the Lord's service. If we see things with a service attitude rather than a spirit of enjoyment, then everything is worshipable. If there is a gap in our hearing, chanting or remembering the Lord, then we will be swallowed by the idea that we are the enjoyer. If we become absorbed in gossip, we will lose the opportunity to associate with *sadhus* and therefore lose the serving mentality."

Devotees consider all objects to be ingredients of the Lord's service. If we see things with a service attitude rather than a spirit of enjoyment, then everything is worshipable. If there is a gap in our hearing, chanting or remembering the Lord, then we will be swallowed by the idea that we are the enjoyer. If we become absorbed in gossip, we will lose the opportunity to associate with *sadhus* and therefore lose the serving mentality.

â€‹	Hearing and chanting about Hari is both *sadhana*, the process of attaining the goal of life, and *sadhya*, the ultimate goal. By good fortune we have received a human body. By good fortune and the grace of guru and Krsna, we have been given an opportunity to serve the Supreme Lord. If we waste our time in idle talk, then we are misusing the gift. It is our duty to always discuss *hari-katha* and to cultivate Krsna consciousness. By doing so we can become the Lord's devotees, become free of the material concept of life, and attain perpetual hapiness.
