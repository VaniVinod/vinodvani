Actual devotees of Krsna never encourage immorality. The lotus feet of Sri Krsna, who is the personalification of religion, are the complete resting place of all morality. The highest form of morality for a spirit soul is to become attach to the Supersoul. The devotees of Krsna are the ultimate limit of this pure attachment.

​	Being perfected and increased million of times, the topmost morality preached by the great soul Jesus Christ is anxiously waiting to serve the morality of love of God as cultivated by the Vaishnavas. 

​	We do not confine our conception only to worldly morality. Our ambition is to attain the morality of transcendental love of God, which is the ultimate goal of everone's life and which is beyond all forms of ordinary and extraordinary morality. When a pure soul is sitauted on the platform of love of God, worldly morality appears insignificant. At the same time, devotees are neither opposed nor attached to world morality. Rather, all forms of morality stand in attendence on spiritual morality, just as a maid servant becomes glorious by serving an exalted personality. 

​	An exalted devotee is always moral. People opposed to morality or who have fallen from the standard can never be considered transcendentalists. Adultery, for example, can never be called devotional service.
