description: "A libreated soul does not desire liberation. The devotees are liberated souls. Therefore, they do not desire religiosity, economic development, sense gratification, or libration. Devotional service is full of happiness. Everything else is devoid of happiness. Thus only a devotee is actually happy, whereas everyone else is distressed and disturbed. Because there is no devotion in the activities of *karmis*, *jyanis*, *yogis*, *bhogis*, and *tyagis*, all of them are restless."

A libreated soul does not desire liberation. The devotees are liberated souls. Therefore, they do not desire religiosity, economic development, sense gratification, or libration. Devotional service is full of happiness. Everything else is devoid of happiness. Thus only a devotee is actually happy, whereas everyone else is distressed and disturbed. Because there is no devotion in the activities of *karmis*, *jyanis*, *yogis*, *bhogis*, and *tyagis*, all of them are restless. Materialists think, "Let me be happy and let other suffer," whereas those walking the unalloyed devotional path think, "Let us perform *hari-kirtana* together twenty-four hours a day without cheating anyone." The path of unalloyed devotion requires no mixes, because chanting the holy name is an infallible weapon. First one hears through the ears, then gradually one finds the other senses favorably engaged. At that point, one becomes qualified to see the form, qualities, pastimes, characteristics, and associates of the Lord. According to this consideration the devotees gradually make advancement on the path of devotional service.
