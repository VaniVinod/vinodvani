description: "A practitioner should know that *anartha-nirvritti* is the last platform before attaining the goal of life. Part of that understanding is to know that unfavorable situations create situations favorable for devotional service in the next moment. If one develops the mentality that everything in this world is meant for Krsna's service, then the propensity for material enjoyment cannot disturb him."

A practitioner should know that *anartha-nirvritti* is the last platform before attaining the goal of life. Part of that understanding is to know that unfavorable situations create situations favorable for devotional service in the next moment. If one develops the mentality that everything in this world is meant for Krsna's service, then the propensity for material enjoyment cannot disturb him. We should all gladly accept whatever pleases Krsna. If Krsna is pleased by making me averse to Him, then I should accept that. Such dependence on the Supreme Lord will protect us. When hearing and chanting about the Lord become prominent in our lives, *anarthas* are gradually and automatically destroyed. We should proceed on the path of devotional service by knowing firmly that following in the footsteps of the eternally perfected spiritual master is the only alternative for attaining our ultimate goal of life.
