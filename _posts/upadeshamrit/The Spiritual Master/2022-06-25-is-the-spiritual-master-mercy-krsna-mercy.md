The spiritual master's mercy and the mercy of Krsna are not two separate things. The spiritual master does not teach anything other than to worship Krsna. Lord Krsna also does not accept any service that has not been rendered by His devotee."

 Lord Krsna bestows mercy upon us and gives all living entities shelter in the form of the spiritual master. *Chaitanya Caritamrita* states, "Krsna is situated in everyone's heart as the *chaitya guru*, the spiritual master within. When He is kind to some fortunate conditioned soul, He personally gives him lessons so he can progress in devotional service, instructing the person as the Supresoul within and the spiritual master without." (CC Add 1.45)

​	"According to the deliberate opinion of all revealed scriptures, the spiritual master is nondifferent from Krsna. Lord Krsna in the form of the spiritual master delivers His devotees." (CC Madhya 22.47)

​	The spiritual master's mercy and the mercy of Krsna are not two separate things. The spiritual master does not teach anything other than to worship Krsna. Lord Krsna also does not accept any service that has not been rendered by His devotee.

​	The spiritual master offers everyone's service to Krsna. The eternally worshipable spiritual master is not an ordinary, mundane human being. In order to deliver the fallen souls the seed of devotional service, the opportunity to serve the Lord. Krsna's mercy comes to us through the spiritual master. *Chaitanya-caritamrita* states, "Out of many millions of wandering living entities, one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bonafide spiritual master by the grace of Krsna. By the mercy of both Krsna and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service." (CC Madhya 19.151)
