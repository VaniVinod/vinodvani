description: "We should give up topics about the material world and repose our full faith in the spiritual master's words, because without the spiritual master's mercy, our *anarthas* cannot be destroyed. We must accept our spiritual master as the only means by which we can go back to Godhead. He is our only eternal well-wisher. Faith means full confidence in the guru's words. We do not rely on the words of so-called gurus, religious reformers, or pretenders."

We should give up topics about the material world and repose our full faith in the spiritual master's words, because without the spiritual master's mercy, our *anarthas* cannot be destroyed. We must accept our spiritual master as the only means by which we can go back to Godhead. He is our only eternal well-wisher. Faith means full confidence in the guru's words. We do not rely on the words of so-called gurus, religious reformers, or pretenders.

​	All our inauspicious qualities will be vanquished simply by associating with *sadhus*. By such association we will attain pure devotional service. Therefore, we should rely implicitly on Sri Gurudeva in order to approach and serve the Absolute Person.

​	A *sadhu* is one who will relieve us from all puzzling doubts. A *sadhu* gives the highest good. We should make friends with such a guru who truly wished our highest good. If perchance we meet such a true guru, we cannot help but be saved and reach our goal. Such a guru will always supply and enrich us with transcendental knowledge and service.
