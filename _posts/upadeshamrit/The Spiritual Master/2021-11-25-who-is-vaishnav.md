description: "Only devotees who are fixed at the spiritual master's Lotus fetet and who are free of material desire are pure. A person who is free from the influence of wealth, women, and the tigress of fame is a Vaishnav. He is detached and pure and can defeat the entire world."

The spiritual master's servants are Vaishnavas. Devotees who are initiated by bonafide gurus and who have taken complete shelter at their spiritual master's feet are Vaishnavas. According to how well we serve the spiritual master, we see differences in the quality of our service to Krsna. Those who abandon their spiritual master or who are envious of him are *avaishnavas*. They are atheist's possessed of a hellish mentality. Those who are envious of the spiritual master are also envious of the Supreme Lord. Actually, they are envious of the whole world. Only devotees who are fixed at the spiritual master's lotus feet and who are free of material desire are pure. A person who is free from the influence of wealth, women, and the tigress of fame is a Vaishnav. He is detached and pure and can defeat the entire world.
