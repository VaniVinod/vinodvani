Sri Radharani is the original predominated absolute. Sri Radha, the daughter of Vrshabhanu, is the crest jewel of all *acaryas* of *madhurya-rasa* and of all lovers of Krsna. Our spiritual master, who is an *acarya* in the line of *madhurya-rasa*, is Sri Radha's dear companion. He is an eternally perfected Vraja-gopi. By discussing the writings of Srila Narottama dasa thakur, which states *guru rupa sakhi baame* , "on the left the sakhi in the form of the spiritual master is situated," it is clearly understood that the spiritual master or *sakhi* is the manifestation of the daughter of Vrshabhanu and is nondifferent from Her.
