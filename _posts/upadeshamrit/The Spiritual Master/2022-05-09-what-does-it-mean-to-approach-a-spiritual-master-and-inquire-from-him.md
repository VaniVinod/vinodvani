description: "The word *pranipat* means to surrender, to hear something with full attention. Without *pranipat* the hearing process is incomplete. Without *pranipaat* there is no way to understand the transcendental Absolute Truth and topics about the spiritual master, Vaishnavas, and the *sastras*."

The word *pranipat* means to surrender, to hear something with full attention. Without *pranipat* the hearing process is incomplete. Without *pranipaat* there is no way to understand the transcendental Absolute Truth and topics about the spiritual master, Vaishnavas, and the *sastras*. 

â€‹	The word *pariprashna* means "honest inquiry," or to humbly inquire from the spiritual master. We should be prepared to hear the reply to our inquiry. Inquiring with a doubtful mind is not honest inquiry. To make a show of inquiring while under the control of false ego is also not honest inquiry. Unless we are fully surrenderred, we cannot make honest inquiry. But unless a subject matter is clarified through honest inquiry we cannot begin our service.
