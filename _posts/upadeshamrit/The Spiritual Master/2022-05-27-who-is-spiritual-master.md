description: "The spiritual master is the one who can protect me from death in the form of material existence. The bonafide spiritual master is the one who can deliver me from the fear or anxiety generated by death. When I approach my spiritual master, I do not need to hear from anyone else. He is the source of all my auspiciousness and the hands into which the all-auspicious Supreme Lord has entrusted my well-being."

The spiritual master is the one who can protect me from death in the form of material existence. The bonafide spiritual master is the one who can deliver me from the fear or anxiety generated by death. When I approach my spiritual master, I do not need to hear from anyone else. He is the source of all my auspiciousness and the hands into which the all-auspicious Supreme Lord has entrusted my well-being. 

By the spiritual master's grace, my mentality of false proprietorship is destroyed. The spiritual master is Krsna's potency. He plants Vedic knowledge in our hearts, makes us feel lower than the straw in the street, make us more tolerant than a tree, removes our desire to be respected, teaches us to offer others our respect, and empowers us to always glorify the Supreme Lord and everything in relation to Him. The spiritual master alone is capable of delivering us from the clutches of Maya.

â€‹	The spiritual master is he who awards me the knowkedge that everyone in this world is worshipable. He teaches me that everyone is my spiritual master and that I am Krsna's eternal servant. He also teaches me that service to Krsna is my constitutional duty.
