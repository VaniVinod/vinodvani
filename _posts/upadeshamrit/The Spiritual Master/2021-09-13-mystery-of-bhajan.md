Only the unalloyed servants of the spiritual masters Sri Svarupa and Sri Rupa can understand the mystery of worshipping the Lord. A devotee who has firm faith in and love for the spiritual master's lotus feet is called an unalloyed servant.

The *Vedas* declare:

```
yasya deve parā bhaktir
yathā deve tathā gurau
tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ
prakāśante mahātmanaḥ
```

"Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed." ~ (**Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.23**)
