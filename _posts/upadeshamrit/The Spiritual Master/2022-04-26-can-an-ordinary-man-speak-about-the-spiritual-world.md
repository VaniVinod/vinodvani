description: "Only those who have descended from the spiritual world can speak about the spiritual world. No one from this world can speak about the spiritual world. When the living entities are fortunate enough to hear about the spiritual world from those who have come from the spiritual world, they gain the opportunity to know about Vaikuntha. We cannot understand transcendental topics by mundane consideration."

Only those who have descended from the spiritual world can speak about the spiritual world. No one from this world can speak about the spiritual world. When the living entities are fortunate enough to hear about the spiritual world from those who have come from the spiritual world, they gain the opportunity to know about Vaikuntha. We cannot understand transcendental topics by mundane consideration. It is not proper to make a compromise between the transcendental and the phenomenal. If we are fortunate, we will meet a Vaikuntha man. Therefore, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu states in Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita: "Krsna is situated in everyone's heart as the *chaitya guru*, the spiritual master within. When He is kind to some fortunate conditioned soul, He personally gives him lessons so he can progress in devotional service, instructing the person as the Supersoul within and the spiritual master without." ~ CC-Madhya Lila 22.47
