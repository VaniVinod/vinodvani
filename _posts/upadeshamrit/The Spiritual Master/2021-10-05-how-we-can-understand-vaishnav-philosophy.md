However learned or thoughful a person may be, until he takes shelter of an acharya whose qualities personlify the Vaishnava philosophy, he cannot understand Vaishnavism. The *bhagwad-gita* states: "Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized souls can impart knowledge unto you because they have seen the truth." (4.34)
	We can understand the Vasihnava philosophy if we posses three specific qualities: unconditional surrender, honest inquiry, and a serving temperament. The teachers of Vaishnava philosophy instruct those who approach an acharya to render these three qualities as *dakshina*. The acharyas are not tempted by mundane *dakshina*.
