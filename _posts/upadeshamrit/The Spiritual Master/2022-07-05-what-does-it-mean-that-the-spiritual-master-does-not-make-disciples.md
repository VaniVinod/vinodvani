description: "An actual spiritual master does not make disciples. Rather, he makes everyone his spiritual master. He makes godless people devotees of Krsna. He pleases Krsna by engaging everyone in the Lord's service. His activities and behaviour are consistent with devotion. He always sees everything in relation to Krsna and in relation to his own spiritual master. He does not see anything with an enjoying spirit or from a mundane viewpoint. As medical professors do not make students but doctors, the spiritual master does not make disciples but spiritual masters."

An actual spiritual master does not make disciples. Rather, he makes everyone his spiritual master. He makes godless people devotees of Krsna. He pleases Krsna by engaging everyone in the Lord's service. His activities and behaviour are consistent with devotion.

As medical professors do not make students but doctors, the spiritual master does not make disciples but spiritual masters.

â€‹	If the Vaishnava does not execute a spiritual master's duty, then the Vaishnava family, the disciplic succession, will be checked. If, however, a Vaishnavs acts as if he were a spiritual master, he will become non-vaishnava. Therefore we should not try to act as if we were spiritual masters if we are not qualified to serve in that way. If we do, we will bring about our own ruination. A spiritual master does not proudly consider himself guru.
