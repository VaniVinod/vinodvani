Proper association with exalted, swanlike personalities destroys our qualification for falling into the dark well of material life. If we associate with librated souls, we will be qualified to become spiritual householders. Those who do not associate with *bhagavatas* to discuss the *Bhagavata*, knowing the two to be nondifferent, will never find fortune in household life. 

It is good for devotees to live at home, because it allows them to peacefully worship Lord Hari. Such peace, however, is not available to those who are too attached to household life, who are gross materialists. It is important to enter family life resolved to serve Krsna. This resolution is far superior to practicing false, monkey renunciation. False renunciation will not help one attain the ultimate goal of life.

One should enter family life only if it is favorable for the execution of devotional service to Hari. If family life is unfavourable, it is a dark well and should be rejected. If one becomes detached from family life just to display his expertise in false renunciation, he will not benefit. Immature renunciants soon fall down.

Association with the Lord's devotees destroys materialism. Those who enter family life only to satisfy worldly morality will become absorbed in materialism. Just as the Lord's devotee must accept the renounced order, he is also required to enter household life. Family life is favorable for devotees, because when a devotee enters family life, he enters a temple. For a devotee, there is no difference between entering household life and entering renounced life. However, household life is unfavourable for non-devotees. There is a huge difference between attached materialists entering household life and the household life of a devotee.

Because a devotee enters family life only to favorably cultivate Krsna consciousness, he should remain aloof from bad association and idle talk. He should faithfully execute the limbs of *bhakti* - his hearing and chanting - with enthusiasm, confidence, and patience. A householder devotee must serve Hari, Guru and the Vaishnavas, chant the Lord's holy name, associate with devotees, and hear *hari-katha*. If all his endeavours are aimed at satisfying Krsna, he will attain good fortune.
