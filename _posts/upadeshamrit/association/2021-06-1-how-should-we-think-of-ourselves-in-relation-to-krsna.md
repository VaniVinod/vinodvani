Unless one thinks himself a servant, he cannot serve. Devotional service requires a relationship between servant and master. We are trying to become masters rather than servants in this world. How then can we serve? Only a servant can serve.

"I will hear, see, chant, and remember with a spirit of enjoyment": this is Karmi's conception,  the conception of a non devotee. If one wishes to progress, he has to renounce this formidable mental conception and learn to remain fixed as the Lord's servant. He should serve twenty-four hours a day subordinate to a devotee and in thaa devotee's association.  Then only will he attain pure devotional service and the ultimate goal of life. If one learns to give up independence and become completely dependent on the spiritual master and Gauranga, then his troubles will vanish and he will become happily engaged in the Lord's service under guru's guidance. If he develops a relationship with Krsna like the relationship between wife and husband, father and son, friend and friend, or servant and master, he will certainly find fortune and Hari's eternal service. It is not possible to render service if one does not have a relationship with the one whom he is serving.

One's relationship with the Lord is revived when one engages in Krishna's service. Even people in this world render service through one of the four relationships. This is because without knowledge of their relationship with the Lord, they developed various temporary relationships. But each of us is the eternal slave of guru and Krishna. Because we have forgotten this simple truth, we have fallen into our present miserable condition. If by the devotees' mercy we can come to remember this truth, we will be saved and will make advancement on the devotional path.
