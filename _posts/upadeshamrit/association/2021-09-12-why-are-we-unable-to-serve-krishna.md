It is impossible to serve Krsna without receiving the mercy of great souls. This is why it is so important to take shelter at the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master. 

The *Caitanya-caritamrita* states:

```
mahat-krpa vina kona karme 'bhakti' naya,

Krsna-bhakti dure rahu, samsara nahe ksaya
```

"Unless one is favoured by a pure devotee, one cannot attain the platform of devotional service. To say nothing of *krsna-bhakti*, one cannot even be relieved from the bondage of material existence." (Madhya 22.51)

If one associates with those devotees who continually serve Krsna, then his propensity to serve Krsna will also be awakened. Without the association of Krsna's devotees, one cannot develop his own desire to engage in the Lord's service. **Service to Hari is not a joke.** It is dependent on the association and mercy of devotees. Simply by following in the devotees' footsteps, one receives the good fortune to engage in the Lord's service.
