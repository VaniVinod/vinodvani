He who says, "Worship the Supreme Lord," is certainly a spiritual master. Only devotees are honest and saintly; others are not. The thoughts of karmis, gyanis, and yogis are born from their aversion towards the Lord. We should reject their association and associate only with Vaishnavas. Only then will we find benefit.
