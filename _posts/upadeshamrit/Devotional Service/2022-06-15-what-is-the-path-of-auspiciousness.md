The mentality that we understand life better than the devotees do leads to hell, and therefore keeping such a mentality is harmful. The secret of success in spiritual life is to follow the path traversed by the lord's devotees. We should follow the devotees no matter how difficult the path."

No path in this material world is auspicious except the path of service to the Lord. The mentality that we understand life better than the devotees do leads to hell, and therefore keeping such a mentality is harmful. The secret of success in spiritual life is to follow the path traversed by the lord's devotees. We should follow the devotees no matter how difficult the path. If we wish to be successful in our following, we must be humble enough to realize how worthless we are. If we understand our disqualification, we can become qualified to see the beauty of the lotus feet of Krsna's devotees. Ordinary human beings are always proposing how to get sense gratification. If we consider such topics religious, we can never become religious. Serving the devotees is the best form of auspiciousness.
