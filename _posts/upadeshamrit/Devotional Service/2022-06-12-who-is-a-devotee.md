title: Who is a devotee?

description: "One who sacrifies his happiness for Krsna's happiness and who remains always engaged in Krsna's service by remouncing his own enjoyment for Krsna's pleasure is a devotee. He certainly attains auspiciousness. Devotional service is the propensity to give Krsna pleasure. The endeavor to make oneself happy is non devotional service and is the source of misery. A non devotee says, "I will become Krsna and intimately enjoy the association of woman." If one rejects such a mentality and becomes inspired by a Vaishnav's ideal example, he is guaranteed good fortune. If he does not keep himself engaged in Krsna's service, he will certainly become a material enjoyer or a dry renunciant rather than a vaishnav."
